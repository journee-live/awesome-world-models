- [ART•V: Auto-Regressive Text-to-Video Generation with Diffusion Models](https://warranweng.github.io/art.v/)

  ART•V is a new AI system that generates videos by creating one frame at a time, using each previous frame as a reference. Unlike other video generation models that try to create the whole video at once, this step-by-step approach helps maintain quality and detail while allowing for more natural motion. It's particularly good at turning text descriptions or single images into fluid videos.
